# -Official-Scratch-popcat-Project-by-puditcoo-
I created a Popcat project on Scratch at school, and this is my first time sharing files publicly. The Scratch file is by "puditcoo," which is actually me, but on a different account at school. This is my main account at home, hence the (Official) label.

Don't mind the weird language in the -removebg-preview.png files and the puditcoo README ver.

If you're curious about what this is or how to play it, it's a Scratch Popcat Project. If you're unfamiliar with it, Scratch is a programming platform. Here's the link because, why not: https://scratch.mit.edu

(How to Play)
1. Download "Scratch Project (2).sb3"
2. Go to https://scratch.mit.edu (Scratch)
3. Click "Start Creating"
4. In the top left, the third icon from the Scratch logo is "File." Click on File and you will see "New, Load from your computer, Save to your computer."
5. Click "Load from your computer" and select "Scratch Project (2).sb3"
6. Done! Click the Cat to pop and collect scores!
